# TodoList

In this project I am making a todo list app.

Since I could not find enough motivation in the main project, I am doing this project as a short-term work.

Laravel, Livewire, Tailwindcss technologies are used.

## How to build the project

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
create a new database called 'LaravelTodoList' (or you can change the name on .env file)

npm install
php artisan projectinit
php artisan serve
```
